\chapter{framework description}
In this chapter we describe the different MPC frameworks that where candidates for our study. First we describe the frameworks for which we have implemented our use cases. We have dedicated one subchapter for each of these frameworks.
First we describe the functionality they provide. Afterwards we describe the MPC technology they utilise to realise their functionality. At last we describe framework-specific details like special algorithms or other optimisations. At the end of the chapter we also provide a brief overview over some MPC frameworks that were candidates for our study but are not part of our final selection.

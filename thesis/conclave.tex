- published in 2019,\\
- combining MPC operations and cleartext processing\\ 
- moving operations outside of MPC to maximise performance\\
- allows to explicitly annotate trust between parties\\
- utilises trust through hybrid operations for additional performance increase \\
- maintaining same end-to-end security as "pure" MPC     \\
- relying on Obliv-C and Sharemind as MPC backend\\
- backend theoretic exchangeable through generic interface\\

- Query optimization aims to move as work outside of mpc\\
- contrary to conventional sql operations that aims to minimize the total amount of work e.g. filters before join \\

- secure against semi-honest adversary \\
- adversary is statically\\
- no secure channel setting\\
- inherits security guarantees of backend -> honest majority \\
- compares to "SMCQL most similar existing system"\\
- jiff dependency \\
- requires python 3.5 \\

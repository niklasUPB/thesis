\section{Contribution}
In our work we have evaluated existing secure multiparty computation frameworks that are able to perform typical database operations, like joins, union, and selects. We started with a pre-selection of 6 frameworks. First, we implemented different use cases with the frameworks on a trial basis, thereby we placed particular emphasis on the usability of the frameworks. Afterwards we selected the three frameworks that were most promising to yield good results and discarded the rest. We then defined several different use cases, that include typical database operations. We implemented the use cases with the selected frameworks and evaluated their performance. Thereby we used different technical tools, to keep our results as robust and reproducible as possible. Finally, we graphically present and discuss the collected data.
